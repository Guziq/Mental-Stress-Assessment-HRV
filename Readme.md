## Introduction

This is my engineering thesis discussing new algorithm for mental stress assessment together with implementation in MATLAB.

## Code
Implementation in MATLAB is attached. Input data should be in text/csv format with following format:
[hh]:[mm]:[ss]	[ms]	[N]
Where first colon is time of last heartbeat and second colon is time in ms since last heartbeat. Last colon signifies that this is NN interval.
